🟢 1. Simple Queue (Linear Queue)

Definition:
A Simple Queue (or Linear Queue) is the basic form of queue that works on the FIFO (First In, First Out) principle.
That means — the first element inserted is the first one to be removed.

Operations:
    . Enqueue: Add element at the rear
    . Dequeue: Remove element from the front

Limitation:
Once the queue is full and elements are removed, empty spaces at the front can’t be reused — causing wastage of space.


Example:
    Front → [10, 20, 30] ← Rear
    After dequeue → [20, 30]
